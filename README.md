Folder-by-Folder Explanation
data/

raw/: Original, untouched dataset(s). Store korean_stock_data.csv here.
interim/: Intermediate files from data cleaning or partial transformations.
processed/: Fully cleaned and feature-engineered data, ready for modeling.
notebooks/

Exploratory notebooks for quick data analysis, visualizations, and prototyping.
Feature engineering and model development notebooks to experiment with new ideas before migrating stable code into src/.
src/

data_ingestion.py: Scripts/functions to load data (possibly in chunks) and handle database or API connections.
data_cleaning.py: Functions for handling missing values, outliers, or merges.
feature_engineering.py: Scripts for computing indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.), applying Savitzky-Golay filters, and other transformations.
model_training.py: Contains the main training loop for LSTM, RL, or Transformer-based models.
model_inference.py: Functions for making predictions in real-time or batch mode.
utils/: Utility scripts such as logging, custom metrics, or re-usable helper functions.
models/

Trained model artifacts, weights, and checkpoints.
Subfolders for each model variant (e.g., lstm/, transformer/, rl/).
configs/

config.yaml or JSON files for hyperparameters, data paths, or environment variables.
Keeps your code flexible and easy to modify without touching the core scripts.
tests/

Unit tests and integration tests to ensure each module (data cleaning, feature engineering, model training) works correctly.
docker/

Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerizing your application.
Useful for deploying your trained models with FastAPI, for instance.
scripts/

run_data_pipeline.sh: Orchestrates data ingestion, cleaning, and feature engineering.
run_training.sh: Kicks off model training.
run_inference.sh: Runs inference on new/unseen data.
requirements.txt

Lists Python package dependencies for reproducibility.
README.md

Explains how to set up the project, run the pipelines, and any additional notes.
